                With diploma in Computer Science and Bachelor Degree in Intelligence System, I have gain a useful amount of knowledge in developing a program. It has been fun learning it and hoping that I could keep learning about it.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also have done an internship at Julytech Sdn Bhd developing multiple module for their POS system and in this internship I have gain much experience about OOP and getting pretty good at programming in flutter. I have also learnt that communication and teamwork are a key to developed a program.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my degree, I have also learned many areas of Artificial Intelligence, from understanding how systems can make decisions on their own to developing projects that apply AI concepts in real-world situations.
                <br />
                <br />Now in my spare time, I try to learn as much as I can about software development, artificial intelligence, and data-related technologies while creating personal projects to improve my skills.
